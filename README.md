Implementation:
InstaShop consists a scanner tool where the user can simply point at a barcode and the tool will read it. If the barcode matches with a product in the database, then it will be added to the cart. If it doesn’t match, then the app will display a message saying that the product doesn’t exists. The scanner tool is implemented using the google vision API.

Cart Functionality: Here the user has couple of options:
1. User has the ability to remove a product from the cart. 
2. User can increase the item count of a product. 
3. At the bottom of the cart screen, there is button called checkout where the user can checkout their items. Upon clicking the checkout button, the user is redirected to the checkout page
